# Phase 1: Dataset Preparation Validation Report

## Validation Objectives

1. Verify dataset transformation consistency
2. Validate image preprocessing techniques
3. Assess augmentation effectiveness
4. Ensure data quality and uniformity

## Validation Metrics

- Image count per wound type
- Image size consistency
- Pixel value normalization
- Augmentation coverage

## Validation Results

### Overall Assessment

- **Size Consistency**: ✅ PASSED
  * All sampled images resized to 224x224
  * Uniform image dimensions maintained

- **Pixel Normalization**: ❌ FAILED
  * Some images did not meet full [0, 1] normalization
  * Requires adjustment in preprocessing pipeline

- **Augmentation Coverage**: ❌ FAILED
  * Not all wound types received sufficient augmentation
  * Specific categories need additional data generation

## Detailed Findings

- Total Wound Types Processed: 10
- Detailed metrics available in:
  * `data/processed_images/dataset_validation_results.json`
  * `data/processed_images/dataset_validation_report.json`

## Recommended Actions

1. Revise normalization strategy in preprocessing script
2. Enhance augmentation logic for underrepresented categories
3. Implement more robust pixel value scaling
4. Ensure consistent augmentation across all wound types

## Next Steps

- Modify preprocessing pipeline
- Rerun dataset validation
- Prepare for model training with improved dataset
