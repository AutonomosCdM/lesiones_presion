## Phase 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing

### 1.1 Dataset Inventory and Validation [Completed: 3/6/2025 17:00]

- Status: ✅ Completed with Findings
- Key Outcomes:
  * Comprehensive dataset inventory script created
  * Validated wound classification dataset
  * Identified resolution and distribution challenges
  * Documented dataset characteristics in dataset_inventory.md

### 1.2 Data Augmentation and Preprocessing [Completed: 3/6/2025 17:32]

- Status: ⚠️ Partially Successful
- Key Outcomes:
  * Successfully processed 10 wound types
  * Resized all images to 224x224 resolution
  * Identified issues with pixel normalization
  * Discovered augmentation coverage gaps

### Validation Findings

- Size Consistency: Passed
- Pixel Normalization: Failed
- Augmentation Coverage: Insufficient

### Next Steps

- Revise preprocessing pipeline
- Improve pixel normalization
- Enhance augmentation strategy
- Rerun dataset validation
- Prepare for model training
