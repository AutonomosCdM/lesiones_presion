- Multi-agent AI system
- Modular design with specialized components
- Microservices-based approach
- RESTful APIs for external integrations
- Event-driven architecture using Kafka

## Key Components

### 1. Image Analysis Agent

- Deep learning model for wound detection
- Image preprocessing pipeline
- Feature extraction and classification
- Integration with hospital imaging systems

### 2. Risk Assessment Agent

- Predictive analytics engine
- Risk scoring algorithm
- Patient history integration
- Real-time risk monitoring

### 3. Treatment Recommendation Agent

- Evidence-based treatment protocols
- Personalized intervention plans
- Drug interaction checking
- Integration with pharmacy systems

### 4. Conversational Interface Agent

- Natural language processing
- Context-aware dialogue management
- Multi-language support
- Voice and text interfaces

## Communication Patterns

- Event-driven communication using Kafka
- Context-aware interactions
- Stateless design for scalability
- API Gateway for external access
- Message queues for asynchronous processing

## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant ImageAgent
    participant RiskAgent
    participant TreatmentAgent
    participant EMR
    
    User->>UI: Uploads wound image
    UI->>ImageAgent: Sends image for analysis
    ImageAgent->>RiskAgent: Sends analysis results
    RiskAgent->>EMR: Fetches patient history
    RiskAgent->>TreatmentAgent: Sends risk assessment
    TreatmentAgent->>UI: Returns treatment plan
    UI->>User: Displays recommendations
```

## Integration Points

1. Hospital EMR System
   - HL7/FHIR integration
   - Patient data synchronization
   - Treatment plan updates

2. Pharmacy Systems
   - Medication ordering
   - Drug interaction checking
   - Prescription tracking

3. Imaging Systems
   - DICOM integration
   - Image metadata extraction
   - Secure image transfer
